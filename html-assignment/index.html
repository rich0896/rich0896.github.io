            <!-- Paragraph 1 of 2. -->
            <p>
                Born on May 30<sup>th</sup> of 2002, I am 21 years old. I got the luck of the draw by getting the <em>only</em> red hair in my immediate, living family. I have 1 sibling, my younger brother. He is 18 years old, born in 2005. I am a major computer nerd, and have been since I was very young.

            <!-- Paragraph 2 of 2. -->
            <p>
                I am in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin College. I chose this program as it features a variety of things that I find very interesting, and luckily for me, have some previous experience in. I enjoy photography, some examples you can see in the section below. I was previously in the Software Engineering Program at the University of Ottawa, and I have played around with <abbr title="Photoshop">PS</abbr> in the past as I have an interest in visual arts.
