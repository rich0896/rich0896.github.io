            <p>
                Born on May 30<sup>th</sup> of 2002, I am 21 years old. I got the luck of the draw by getting the <em>only</em> red hair in my immediate, living family. I have 1 sibling, my younger brother. He is 18 years old.

                I am in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin College. I chose this program as it features a variety of things that I find very interesting, and luckily for me, have some previous experience in. I enjoy photography, some examples you can see in the section below.
