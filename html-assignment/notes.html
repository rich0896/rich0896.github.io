            <!-- Description list of HTML elements -->
            <h3>Here are a few HTML elements I have learned so far:</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Description Lists</dt>
                <dd>Description lists are a type of list you're seeing right now. I was unaware of their existence before.</dd>
                <dt>Article</dt>
                <dd>An article element houses blog or forum posts, newspaper articles and similar content on a webpage. I was only really aware of <i>divs</i> before, so articles are new for me.</dd>
                <dt>Section</dt>
                <dd>A <i>section</i> element defines a block of information that contains content relevant to eachother. Much like articles, they are a container element I had not witnessed.</dd>
                <dt>Anchor Navigation</dt>
                <dd>While I was aware of anchor elements to hyperlink to other webpages, I was not aware of the ability to target IDs within a webpage.</dd>
                <dt>HTML Entities</dt>
                <dd>While not an element in the same sense as the others, I had not known about entities and character codes, and their existence makes adding special character elements far easier. &capbrcup;&parallel;&TRADE;&trpezium;</dd>
